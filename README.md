## Modes:
### Numbers
Generate a single random number using only a minimum and maximum number. The simplest way to generate numbers.
### Dice
Generate up to 6 random numbers using dice from a D4 to a D20.
### Cards
Generate up to 7 random numbers using cards. You can display the numbers, cards drawn, and the point values of them. Will output the cards as either only numbers (1-13), or including face cards (Ace, 1-10, Jack, Queen, King). The point value is toggleable and you can change whether the Ace is worth 1 or 11 points.
### Marbles
Generate up to 5 random numbers and letters using marbles.
