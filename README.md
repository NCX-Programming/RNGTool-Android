# RNGTool Android
The best way to generate random numbers on Android 8.0+ (kinda)

![](https://github.com/NCX-Programming/RNGTool-Android/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

## Modes:
### Numbers
Generate a single random number using only a minimum and maximum number. The simplest way to generate numbers.
### Dice
Generate up to 6 random numbers using dice from a D4 to a D20.
### Cards (WIP)
Generate up to 7 random numbers using cards. You can display the numbers, cards drawn, and the point values of them. Will output the cards as either only numbers (1-13), or including face cards (Ace, 1-10, Jack, Queen, King). The point value is toggleable and you can change whether the Ace is worth 1 or 11 points.
### Marbles
Generate up to 5 random numbers and letters using marbles.
## System Requirements
- At least Android 8.0 or higher
## Installation
RNGTool Android is still in early beta, but you can find development builds in ![Github Actions](https://github.com/NCX-Programming/RNGTool-Android/actions) that you can install on your Android device.
